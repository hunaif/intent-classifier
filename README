Ideally run inside a python 3.5.2 virtual environment

Prerequisites:
Please ensure that spacy is installed and spacy models are downloaded and linked to "en".
 1) spacy
       pip install spacy
       python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
       python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en

To run the code:
 1) clone the project and get inside the project
        cd intent-classifier
 2) Install requirements:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
 2) cd src
 3) python IntentClassifier.py
    - This prints the f1 and saves the model in intent-classifier/model/
 4) python IntentClassifierServer.py
    - This will run a service by default at port 8081
    - If required the port can be changed from Constants.py
    - Send a post request to the service
       eg:
       Request:
       curl -X POST   http://localhost:8081/predict -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"query":"what time is it"}'

       Response:
       {"probability": 0.7848451831445732, "label": "when"}

The best model has f1 around 0.89

In case of any path issues (Like loading model, saving model), please edit the Constants.py and try giving the absolute path
